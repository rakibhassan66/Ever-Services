## About this application:

**National Service App** is a comprehensive mobile application designed to provide citizens with seamless access to a wide range of public services. The app focuses on empowering users by eliminating common issues such as corruption, delays, and inefficiencies typically faced when accessing government services. It integrates multiple essential services into one platform, including health, education, judicial, transportation, social welfare, tax and revenue, defense, and public administration services.

By centralizing these services, the app ensures transparency, fairness, and ease of use, allowing citizens to exercise their rights and access critical resources without fear of exploitation. Developed in Android Studio with a modern user interface designed in Figma, the app aims to be a reliable tool for improving public service delivery and enhancing the quality of life for all users.
